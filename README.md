# **Logistic Regression**

We will implement logistic regressions in Python with the datasets "gender-purchase" and "bank" using the Scikit-learn and Statsmodels libraries.





> Código T5-1 : We calculate the conditional probability based on the information provided by the dataset.


> Código T5-2 : We apply the maximum likelihood method and obtain the summary using Statsmodels.


> Código T5-3: We apply logistic regression for bank predictions, using the "bank" dataset. We perform an exploratory analysis, implement the model with Statsmodels API and Scikit-learn, and then validate it using cross-validation, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.




## **Datasets**
*   gender-purchase
*   bank
